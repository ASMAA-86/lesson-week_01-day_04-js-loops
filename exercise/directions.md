# Exercises: JavaScript loops

## Print every number from 0 to 10

## Print every number from 4 to -16

## Print every fifth number from 8 to 41

## The classic Fizzbuzz Program

For every `number` between 1 and 100...

If the `number` is evenly divisible by 3, print "Fizz"

If the `number` is evenly divisible by 5, print "Buzz"

If the `number` is evenly divisible by 3 AND evenly divisible by 5, print "Fizzbuzz"

## The even/odd reporter

Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").

## Multiplication Tables

Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").

Bonus: Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).

## The Grade Assigner

Check the results of assignGrade function from the conditionals exercise for every value from 60 to 100 - so your log should show "For 89, you got a B. For 90, you got an A.", etc.

## Golf

Using the condition you made before in the conditionals exercise, log out the nickname of every score from 1 to 8 on a par 5 hole

Bonus: Use a nested for loop to run the same piece of code, but with par changing from 3 to 5

## The Rest

Make the rest of the programs you made in the conditional exercises use loops in some way (if possible)

## 99 Bottles of Beer

Write a script that prints the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" in the terminal. If you're unfamiliar with the song, you can find the lyrics [here](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html).

Make sure your program can handle both singular and plural cases (i.e. both "100 bottles of beer" and "1 bottle of beer").
